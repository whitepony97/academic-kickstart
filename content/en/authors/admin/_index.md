&emsp;I am studying in the School of Optics and Electronic Information (OEI) of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Integrated Circuit Design and Integrated System.The core courses of study are as follows:

- CMOS Analog Integrated Circuit
- Fundamentals of Digital Integrated Circuit
- Verilog HDL and Design of Digital System
- CMOS RF IC
- Principles of Computer Organization
- Processor Architecture
- Digital Signal Processing
- Physics of Semiconductor Devices

&emsp;At present, I have been recommended to Academy for Engineering and Technology, Fudan University (FAET) to study for a master's degree in computer science. I have joined the Custom Intelligent Hardware Laboratory (CiH Lab) in December 2019, where I will learn AI chip design for robots supervised by Prof.Chixiao Chen.
